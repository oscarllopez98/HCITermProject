        <h2 class="mb-4">Problem Proposal</h2>
        <p>Remote learning, although connected, is actually very disconnected, meaning there is limited interaction between users. Our group identified the problem being there currently does not exist a two sided IDE, an IDE that can be simultaneously edited and run by two or more people with results displaying in real time, that allows users to engage in pair/cooperative programming.</p>
        <p>If one were to exist it would allow the teacher and student to have live interactive lessons, and allow for pairs working on projects together to work live remotely. Looking at Teletype for Atom we realized our idea was similar to Atom. However, we believe we are aiming for more autonomy. We want to allow developers to move independently from each other.</p>

                  <p>Remote work is increasingly important in the modern COVID-afflicted society. There exist many tools to facilitate tele-collaboration on all sorts of projects, but few mainstream options for remote tandem software development.  This is a problem both educationally and professionally.  Having a more effective platform for collaborating on software development can facilitate better planning, and therefor better performance and evaluation of software both by colleagues and instructors. As we see from Hattie and Timperley, better evaluation and feedback can help to improve student outcomes[1]. Our research and resulting solution will focus on how we can provide an effective learning tool to help improve student code quality and speed of completion for group assignments. A typical interaction related to our research problem would be one that many UGA Computer Science students are familiar with: That of attempting to organize and complete group work remotely. Framed within the Seven Stages of Action[2] we can describe the interaction as follows:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Goal: The goal of our participants is to solve a computer programming problem without face-to-face interaction.</li>
                      <li>Planning: Our participants would need to complete this task through some sort of remote communications application (maybe something we could consider integrating into our solution in the future), and agree on when, for how long, and on what they will be working.</li>
                      <li>Specify: Participants can currently specify tasks needing complete both verbally and in writing.</li>
                      <li>Perform: If all goes according to plan, students will perform the specified actions within the specified time frame.</li>
                      <li>Perceive: Participants will perceive the status of their work based on feedback from peers, and effectiveness of their solution based on testing.</li>
                      <li>Feedback: Results can be evaluated by group members by their own pre-determined metrics, done after each participant has submitted his or her portion of the work.</li>
                      <li>Compare: Results are compared to the original goals laid out in the planning and goal phases, and actions are taken (or not) based on the level of success.</li>
                    </ol>

                  <p>Our problem of study is remote learning and the ways we can improve it to better suit the needs of students who are just beginning their journey of programming. There are a few existing solutions for our problem of study including the following: Git Duck, Code Together, and Code Sandbox. All this software has specific pros. Git Duck is a recent solution from 2019 that focuses on a collaborative coding experience with built in video chat options. Code Together is a pair programming add-on where one hosts a screen share of their ide for another programmer to join in. Code Sandbox is the most interesting option out of the three because it focuses on web development. Furthermore, CodeSandbox was created with a classroom setting in mind with its Classroom Mode feature, which allows the host to allow participants to edit, as if in a classroom whiteboard scenario. The key is that all of these technologies focus on the pair programming experience of developers. However, that is where the issue lies, these solutions are made for the experienced, not the novice. There is a need for a pair programming experience designed for students, by students, who understand the struggles of embarking on the journey into programming.

                  <p>There are not any formal, accepted guidelines in place for how any kind of IDE should be developed. However, most IDEs are developed with at least these three core principles in mind: unique features, high performance, and interface simplicity. Which of these principles a particular IDE’s development team focuses on is often subject to the primary use case of that IDE. For IDEs primarily used for a specific language or framework, like IntelliJ or Pycharm, having features unique to that programming language to help expedite the development process is essential to focus on. For other IDEs like Android Studio and Xcode, which have emulators running inside of what are already very feature-heavy IDEs, optimizing performance is a primary focus. These IDEs often require more CPU resources than the average IDE. Interface simplicity is something that all IDE development teams must focus on, but it becomes difficult to pack in a lot of features while also keeping the interface from getting too cluttered. So, while this is a core principle of most IDE development teams, it often isn’t the top priority. Something similar to IDEs that focuses on a simple interface over a lot of features are plain text editors like Sublime Text and Atom that allow users to start with a very simple interface and add plugins for different functionalities as they continue to use the software.

                  <p>For our solution have proposed to develop a two-sided IDE, to allow users to engage in pair/cooperative programming. To ensure pair/cooperative programming is successful we wanted to establish an Integrated Development Environment that can be simultaneously edited run by two or more people with results displayed in real time. Because we are focused on those new to programming, we felt it was necessary to have clear signifiers displaying exactly what a user can and cannot do. In order to make our two-sided IDE successful our interface will afford the ability to be seen on multiple user ends. To fortify productive projects within our interface we will have what many interfaces have, which is distinct signifiers indicating mistakes in code to afford an efficient debugging process. In comparison to existing solutions, we have found that our solution will be similar in some ways. We want the novice user to be introduced into an environment that is not something to be fearful of. We found that many of the current existing solutions focus on the experienced user, thus the actual interface of current project being worked on look intimidating. We want for our users to have a simple yet efficient IDE for programming. Some of the existing solutions such as Code Together, is software needing to be installed on a user’s computer. However, for our approach we found that we wanted our interface to be more web based allowing for data to be centralized and accessible at all times. Allowing users to work from anywhere at any time. We found that the existing solutions are continuously growing and developing to become more efficient and user friendly, however as previously mentioned these technologies focus on those with more experience. We want our solution to be the change that helps those with no to little experience to evolve into successful programmers.

Introductory tasks include creating and removing files, creating and running a simple “Hello World” program, and using the chat and request help features to communicate with the professor.</li>
                      <li>Retention Over Time &#8212; We will measure users’ retention over time over a fixed period because our team wants users to be able to independently use the product, so they require as little assistance from the professor as possible during lectures. We will form tasks and assign them to the user repeatedly throughout the week, monitoring how little they need assistance in the tasks.</li>
                      <li>Subjective Satisfaction &#8212; We will measure the users’ subjective satisfaction because ensuring that our users feel satisfied with using the product will help guide future design and allow our User base to grow.

                    <p>When considering what we felt necessary for our User Experience, we found 4 key ideas that we wanted to emphasize.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p class="lead">Public/Private</p>As an Instructor, I want to be able to divide Students into their own IDE sessions, so that I am able to help Students on a one-on-one basis.</li>
                      <li><p class="lead">Elementary</p>As a Student, I want to navigate an elementary interface, so that I do not get confused by the amount of options.</li>
                      <li><p class="lead">Accessible</p>As a Student, I want to be able to access my Instructor’s lecture via video chat, so that I can learn class material.</li>
                      <li><p class="lead">Requestable Help</p>As a Student. I want to be able to notify my Instructor and other Students via chat function, so that I can give and receive assistance and feedback.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Our justification for choosing our main 4 User Stories is as follows. These User Stories are what separate our idea from a standard IDE or in class education. User Story 1 shows accessibility, User Story 2 shows the ability to request help from the professor, User Story 6 shows the ability to select between one-on-one sessions or group sessions, and User Story 10 demonstrates the idea of simplicity, as our focus for our service revolves around into-level programmers.</p>

                    <p>The designs we came up with for User Story 1 involved a large amount of ideas that took shape in multiple ways for the steps involved in accomplishing the user story.
                      <ul>
                        <li>As a Student, I want to be able to access my Instructor's lecture via video chat, so that I can learn class material.</li>
                      </ul>
                      While we were designing our initial ideas for logging in an joining a session, we relied upon the work of Don Norman. Specifically his idea of Discoverability, "Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?" This quote sums up our intentions when following through with the production of our wireframes. As a group, we decided upon making our program easy to use and understand. The most interesting part of the design process for this user story was that we all had various ideas that culminated in the default student window, join session window, and the initial login window. These different pages had various levels of detail, and as discussed in the video, they all contributed to mockups that are shown further along in the presentation.

                    <p>For the user story related to requesting help, we felt that it was important to have a “request help” function that was independent from the chat function so that students could privately request assistance from the instructor. The students can do this by using the help request button in their IDE, signified with the text “Request Help”. This will cause the student to be added to the help request queue, which is visible only from the instructor’s interface. The instructor can then select the first student on the queue to be put into a one-on-one session with that student where she can privately ask the instructor for help or assistance. After helping the student, the student is removed from the queue (though the instructor can manually retain the student in the queue if she wants to follow-up again), and the instructor can move on to the next student in the queue or return to the normal session. We also decided that it was best to show the student their place in the queue as a means of feedback after they ask for help, and we also gave the student an option to cancel the request before the instructor gets to her in case she no longer needs help. As mentioned before, we focused heavily on the concept of discoverability when designing our interface, so it was important that students could easily figure out how this function works. We believe that we have accomplished this through good organization and clear signifiers.

                    <p>When considering how to design a wireframe to address the user story for breakout sessions, we decided to base the functionality, if not the interface design itself, on Zoom.  We felt that Zoom offered a fairly robust breakout system[1][2].  We wanted to give instructors a way to trigger breakouts easily, and to have options for customizing how those breakouts would be structured.  We wanted to have clear signifiers for our users, and consistent, simple to understand feedback as well.  Finally, we wanted to stay consistent with the mapping principles laid out by Norman [3]. Our first wireframe (labeled “First Pass” in the breakout presentation link) had a small cluster of menu buttons in the top righthand corner of the screen.  We initially felt that an always visible set of controls would be most useful.  First Pass also includes views for when either group of individual breakouts are selected.  We show each of these from the instructor and student view.  The student group view allows students to collaborate on a single coding space, similar to google docs. Our second wireframe, labeled “Second Pass” expands on the features needed to allow for a robust instructor experience in the creation of breakout groups.  We have included the ability to generate groups randomly by number of members, or by a set number of groups.  We have also included the ability for instructors to launch pre-set groups based on his or her needs.  We made the decision to include breakout options with a main toolbar on the left hand side of the screen, since once the breakouts are created, a user no longer needs to see options for their creation.  Clicking on this tool will open a popup window with options.  This wireframe includes artboards to display the instructor’s view of creating groups and what an instructor might see upon successful creation of breakouts.  We added a pane to the right of the screen to allow for navigation through the various breakout sessions. Our third alternative, labeled “Third Pass” implements the breakout options again as a standalone button, but this time with a drop-down menu for randomized or predetermined groups.  In this wireframe we dove more deeply into how an instructor might configure preset breakout groups, and moved the navigation pane from the right hand side of the screen to the bottom middle section.  We felt that allowing instructors to have a variety of methods for creating predefined groups would enhance the user experience and provide flexibility for applications of our potential product.  In this wireframe, we can see the instructor view as he or she selects the breakout dropdown, and can then choose to randomize groups, load a configuration, or create a configuration.  If the user opts to build a configuration for later use, they can click on students (signified by a green outline on their square), enter student IDs, or enter student emails.  Whether the user selects randomized or preconfigured breakouts, they will have  the ability to navigate between groups quickly and easily through the panel of breakout room links.

                  <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>Throughout our mockup process you will see how we took the best designs from each alternative designed wireframe and formulated a higher fidelity mockup. For the first user story regarding accessibility to a user’s Instructor’s lecture. The student or instructor is welcomed with a login screen. You can see we designed a simple but clear logo representing “pair programming”. Like many other interfaces the user is able to type in their username and password. In the bottom right corner we can see a login button clearly indicating to a user they will press this in order to login. Once a user logs in they will be met with the screen that actually allows a user to access the instructors lecture. The student will join with their instructor’s session ID and the instructor will host with a specified session. We found this to be the best design because the interface displays exactly what a user can do, and the user cannot stray from the given options. Again simplicity is key for our solution.
                      <br>
                      From here we are met with the default student screen. This screen and screens following will Display how our mock up designs are in parallel with our user story regarding an elementary interface.  We can see for the student they are able to minimize or collapse their file directory allowing for more area for one's text editors. If a user desires even more room for their text editor they are also able to  press the view button which will then change a students interface to displaying only their text editor. We believed that having this option to display both the student and instructor text editor or simply just the students was important for our design and something many of us found useful. For our button layout in the center we decided to list the clickable buttons on our interface in the order we found relevant. When coding a user will most likely type some code then will try to compile their code. If the code is unsuccessful they are greeted with a clear signifier stating compile error and the user attempts again. Again the user will compile their code and if the code is successfully compiled they will then run their code with the “run” button and the output is displayed in the console. They then will end their program with the “end” button. If there were issues they would be able to debug with the “debug” button and if they are unsuccessful at trying to debug their own code they may request help. We found the view button and theme button were not needed as much when it came to the hierarchy of importance, due to those being more of a user experience. We decided to put those buttons towards the bottom. For the chat we designed the chat to be at the top of the screen to allow more horizontal real estate for the text editors so that a user's code would not formulate on multiple lines as quickly, had been vertically put. We found that the collapsible main menu and other tools would also allow for more real estate for the chat function if wanted.
                      <br>
                      If we look at the instructor's view it is similar in the sense of simplicity. A lot of the same buttons are displayed except the view button. The instructor has the option to change how many students' video feeds are displayed. We wanted The instructor to have this option of a speaker view of the student who is speaking no student view to allow a more simplistic interface display or the typical default multiple student view. Again our goal was an elementary and simple interface.
                      <br>
                      Next on our mock ups of user stories we will look at the user story regarding students to receive and request help.  Starting with the student we believed the easiest and most concise way for a student to request help was to have a help request button similar to one raising their hand in class. This is a clickable button to which when the student presses it the interface notifies them that their help request has been received, due to the help request hand then displaying “getting help “ . From there the student also sees what number in line they are to receive help. If a student is waiting and realizes that help is no longer needed the user is also given an option to cancel help. This allows the instructor to get to the people that truly need help rather wasting time figuring out who did and did not actually need assistance. We found that the aspect of confirmation that a button was pressed and options to undo an action were something that we specifically preferred. As Don Norman states in his book The Design of Everyday Things, “The human nervous system is equipped with numerous feedback mechanisms, including visual, auditory, and touch sensors, as well as … muscle and limb movements.” Our feedback to the Help request button appeals to human’s visual sensors.
                      <br>
                      When we make our way to the instructor’s view of help requests we see the instructor has a similar clickable button in the shape of a hand however stating “help requests”. From here the instructor is able to click on the help requests button and the screens found within the interface are resized to allow a new section within the instructors screen. This will allow the instructor to actively see all help requests and whether they are being currently helped or waiting. When looking at the text editor within the IDE, it clearly states what students code an instructor is looking at due to the clear signifier in the top left corner of the text editor. If you look at the help requests window there are  green signifiers and a label  “currently helping” displaying to the instructor who is currently being helped. The red signifier and label “waiting” displays to the instructor who is currently waiting in the queue. The clickable button “ next student” allows the  instructor when finished helping  the current student, move on to the next student waiting. When the instructor presses the button “next student”, the text editor displayed then changes to the next student the instructor is helping and the student who received assistance is now out of the queue. To end the instructors help session, we made a clickable button with the label “end help session” signifying that when clicked the help request window will close . We wanted the help request window to be something easy accessible for the instructor at all times, so that if a student needed help the instructor would be aware.
                      <br>
                      Last but not least we will look into the mockup for the user story regarding an instructor to divide students into their own IDE sessions aka breakouts.  For this we will start by looking at the instructor view. We believed that the instructor should have a breakout button signified by a clickable button with a group of people resembling a meeting situation. When the instructor clicks on this button a popup window appears for the instructor. We felt that having a popup window rather than a window appearing on the interface was a better idea because once the breakout groups were made the instructor would not need that window again. The instructor is presented with the options for a breakout group along with an area to type the instructions or prompt for that specific breakout session. The instructor is able to click on what type of breakout groups they wanted to choose and there is a clear check signifier displaying to them their  current choice. Once confirmed the instructor is now in a breakout session view. The instructor is able to see each student's code by pressing the buttons labeled “next student code “or “previous student code “. We thought this would be a beneficial aspect to include for an instructor to see each student's code to determine if one was stuck, or how far the students were with the designated task. Once the instructor finds that breakout groups can be over with the instructor will press the button labeled “ end breakout “ to close the breakout groups.
                      <br>If we look at the students view for a breakout session. The students interface looks similar to the default one however instead of the instructors text editor there are the instructors instructions or prompt for the breakout groups. Again we wanted this window to be collapsible for more area for the text editor to have
                      <br>Overall we found our mockups to be designed in a way that is consistent with our target audience which is those new to programming. We have elementary ideals and designs found within our mockups. Through our collaborative design on the wireframes and each alternative design of wireframes we believe that we took the best design choices to be included in our mock-ups and overall solution to the proposed problem.
